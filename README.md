# 2D-Open-World-v.0.3
This is an old project that I worked on a while ago. I learned a decent amount about unity while making this project, but it's pretty outdated at this point. There's likely some buggy code as I've improved in my programming and unity knowlege over the years. This is mostly here as a way to document my progress from where I initially started with unity.
