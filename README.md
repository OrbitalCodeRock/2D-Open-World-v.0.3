# 2D-Fixed-Open-World-10
This is the 10th version of a Open World project I worked on a while ago. The main reason I had stopped working on it was due to problems with damage calculation. Recently, I have found a way to fix this issue and may start working on it more. Made with Unity Engine and c#.
